# AI Service Booking Platform

A production-style home and service installation booking platform for a software engineering portfolio.

This project is a normal service booking and operations platform. AI is an additional engineering feature that assists customers with booking intent, service discovery, availability questions, and booking preparation.

## Core Actors

- Customer
- Operations/Admin
- Technician

## Approved Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, React Router, Redux Toolkit where justified, React Hook Form, Zod, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL, Prisma
- Caching: Redis
- Testing: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- Infrastructure: Docker, GitHub Actions
- AI: Claude API
- API style: versioned REST API

## Current Status

Milestone 12 (search, filtering, pagination, and performance) is complete: one shared list contract (`page`/`limit`/`sort`/status filter, `paginationMeta`) across every collection endpoint. Customer and technician booking lists gained DB-side pagination + filtering (previously unbounded); operations technicians gained sorting. Deterministic `id`-tiebroken ordering, server-bounded params (`422`, no clamping), no client-supplied Prisma filters. Query plans measured on ~3k bookings — existing indexes cover every list query sub-millisecond, so no index was added. Milestones 1–12 are complete with CI green. Redis caching, payments, and AI features are not implemented yet.

See [docs/milestones.md](docs/milestones.md) for the canonical milestone plan and the current milestone.
