## Current Status

Milestone 7 (availability & scheduling) is in progress: a public availability lookup for active services (`GET /api/v1/services/:slug/availability`) and technician self-service slot management (`/api/v1/technician/availability`) with per-row ownership and database-enforced overlap prevention, plus customer and technician scheduling UIs. Milestones 1–6 are complete with CI green. Booking creation, technician assignment, pricing, dashboard, and AI features are not implemented yet.

See [docs/milestones.md](docs/milestones.md) for the canonical milestone plan and the current milestone.
